# Virtual Machine and OS
A virtual machine, that runs a simple Operational System. Everything here is implemented in Java, for OS subject's final test, in PUCRS university. 

## Usage
- To run this project, after cloning it, you should simply run the ```Application.java``` file.
- To choose which program to run, just run the command ```s <PROGRAM_NUMBER>```. For instance: 's 1' runs the program ```p1.txt```
- To give values for the programs that require input, just type ``` c <INT_VALUE> ```. For instance: 'c 5' sends the number 5 to the console.
- The programs should be named as ```p<NUMBER>.txt``` to properly work
- In the end of each process, a memory dump is given, before clearing the process from the memory.

## Description
The OS, that runs in the virtual machine, simulates the basic aspects of a real OS, just as process management, memory management, memory pagination, PCBs, etc. The OS only accepts INT inputs. The processes that can run in it are individual programs, writen in its assembly language. You can also try writing new programs and run them. The group implemented this project using Java Threads as well, so that everything could be concurrent, just as in a real OS. Please note that all of this was made for learning pouposes only.

## OS Main Parts
In this section, you will cover al the basic classes of the OS and how they work and are related.

### GP
The GP, meaning Process Manager (Gerenciador de Processos), is reponsible for creating and finalizing processes. When created, the process is stored in a segment of the memory, which is allocated by the Memory Manager (GM), and then, it is sent to the Ready Queue. When finalized, the process is cleared from the memory. 

### GM
This is the Memory Manager (Gerente de MemÃ³ria), responsible for allocating and deallocating the memory, mapping each program to its correct memory frame.

### Thread Escalonador
This class is treated as a Java Thread, and its responsible for coordinating which process goes to the CPU (to run) and which ones keep waiting or keep blocked.

### Thread CPU
The CPU is also a Thread, and it executes each assembly command the processes have, running them, one by one, until the running process gets interrupted by timer, STOP command, or some errors, such as Illegal Memory Access.

### Rotinas
The Routines contain a bunch of functions, that are executed for each specific Interruption the CPU generates. For instance, when a process stops, reaching the STOP command, a routine is called, clearing the process from the memory, and putting the next one in the CPU.

### Thread Application (Shell)
This is the Shell of the OS, responsible for reading the entries of the user, that chooses the next program to run.

### Thread Console
The console is responsible for printing eventual outputs the process can return. It also waits a process to call for an input, asking it for the user. Please, note that our OS only accepts INT inputs.


## Programs
The programs are stored in the ```in``` folder.
 - ```p1.txt```: Calculates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence.
 - ```p2.txt```: Reads a value from a position in the memory, and calculates the Fibonacci Sequence, or puts -1 in memory, if the number is negative.
 - ```p3.txt```: Calculates the factorial of a number.
 - ```p4.txt```: Sorts a  vector using Bubble Sort.
 - ```p5.txt```: Given the input of a number N, calculates the first N number of the Fibonacci Sequence after the two first numbers, for I/O simulation pourposes. For instance: given 5, returns 0 1 1 2 3 5 8.
 - ```p6.txt```: Calculates the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence, resulting in Illegal Memory Access Error, for simulation pourposes.
 - ```p7.txt```: Calculates the factorial of a number and writes this value, using the Console output, for I/O simulation pourposes.
 
 ## Assembly Commands
 Next, there is a table with the assembly commands the CPU supports, therefore, the ones that can be used to write a program. If you wish to add more Assembly Commands, you can always add them in the CPU and in the Opcode enums.
- ``` PC ``` means Program Counter
-  ``` k ``` means an integer number
-  ``` R1 ``` means Register 1
-  ``` R2 ``` means Register 2
-  ``` [A] ``` means a position in the memory, pointed by the value of an integer A
-  ``` [R1] ``` means a position in the memory, pointed by the value in R1
-  ``` [R2] ``` means a position in the memory, pointed by the value in R2
